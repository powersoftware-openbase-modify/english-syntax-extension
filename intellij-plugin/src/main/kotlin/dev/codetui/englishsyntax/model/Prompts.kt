 * 成分粒度的四条边界，以及它们必须按这个顺序出现的原因。
 *
 * completeness-first 排在最前：先判输入是否构成分句（带定式谓语、或省略主语的
 * 祈使句，都算分句），再交给 clause-first 决定分句层级——不构成分句的片段标
 * FRAGMENT_HEAD，不为凑句型凭空造主谓宾。
 *
 * 缺了这四条，同一个模型（deepseek-v4-flash）对指令型文本会给出词级碎片：实测
 * "Help turn ideas into fully formed designs and specs through natural collaborative
 * dialogue." 被切成 8-9 个成分——Help / turn 两个 PREDICATE、介词 into 与其宾语拆开、
 * 拆出来的名词短语再误标 ATTRIBUTE；补上后稳定收敛到 4 个短语级成分。
 * 判定顺序必须写死"先分句、再句内"：只把分句规则与 peer 规则并列摆着，两条会
 * 互相打架，实测同一句在两次调用之间会在两种切法之间跳。所以 peer 规则也收窄成
 * 「在单个分句之内」——它原本要挡的"谓语吞掉宾语"照旧被挡住。
 *
 * **CORE_PROMPT_VERSION 8 彻底废弃了 COORDINATE_CLAUSE 输出。** 版本 7 虽然已经让
 * validator 拒绝这种整块分句，提示词里却还残留「每个并列分句输出一个
 * COORDINATE_CLAUSE」的旧指令，模型照做后必然进入修复轮。现在所有并列句都按
 * subject/predicate/object 等同层成分平铺，只把 FANBOYS 并列连词单独标为
 * CONJUNCTION；分号可以连接两个分句，但不需要为它生成成分。
 *
 * 与 Chrome 端 `prompts.ts` 逐字一致，由 shared-fixtures/core-prompt-parity.json 钉住。

A heading, list item, noun phrase, adjective phrase, or non-finite verb phrase that does not form a clause must contain exactly one FRAGMENT_HEAD; never invent SUBJECT, PREDICATE, OBJECT, PREDICATIVE, or ADVERBIAL merely to force a fragment into a clause pattern. Keep ordinary determiners and tightly bound single-word premodifiers with the FRAGMENT_HEAD, and emit separable postmodifying prepositional, participial, or infinitive phrases as ATTRIBUTE. \"Portable API support across AI providers for Chat, text-to-image, and Embedding models\" is FRAGMENT_HEAD \"Portable API support\" plus ATTRIBUTE \"across AI providers\" plus ATTRIBUTE \"for Chat, text-to-image, and Embedding models\".
